# Tip Me Now

Sometimes you do something so good, that you should be tipped.

It's a PWA, so you can go ahead and add it to your device and use it offline.

### Tailwind for PWA

In order to have tailwind for offline use, it needs to be generated as css.

That has been setup by doing the following

1. `npx tailwindcss init`
2. added `index.html` to content on `tailwind.config.js`
3. `npx tailwindcss -o style.css`
