Do you ever think to yourself: _"What I said was so good, that I should get a tip_?

Try [Tip Me Now](https://greyteddy.github.io/tip-me-now/)

- Landscape is supported only, preferably held with both hands.
- Only 25% tipping is accepted, because that's what your deserve. 
- It's a [PWA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFsRylCQblw), so you can go ahead and add it to your device and use it offline.

### Tailwind for PWA

In order to have tailwind for offline use, it needs to be generated as css.

That has been setup by doing the following

1. `npx tailwindcss init`
2. added `index.html` to content on `tailwind.config.js`
3. `npx tailwindcss -o style.css`

This is a joke application.

If you do a small favour to a friend, you can show this screen as a form of light banter.

Workers should be paid fairly.
